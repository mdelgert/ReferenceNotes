How to fix Aftershokz mute beeping issue?

Fix 1: Headphone workaround
Put Teams on mute. This will cause you to hear beeping through your headphones.
Then, unmute the headphones by simultaneously pressing + and – buttons for 2 seconds.
You will get the “Mute Off” notification but will remain in mute.

Fix 2: Altering Windows settings
In the start menu, right-click the volume button and select “Sound settings.”
Scroll down and select “More sound options.”
Select your microphone by clicking the Recording option. Select “Properties.”
If you go to the “Levels” menu, you may notice that your headset is muted by default. Uncheck the box.
