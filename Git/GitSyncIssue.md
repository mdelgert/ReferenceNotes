The error **"Actual command not found, wanted to execute git.sync /8"** in VS Code typically indicates an issue with the Git extension or configuration. Here are possible causes and solutions:

---

### ✅ **1. Ensure Git is Installed and Accessible**
- Make sure Git is installed on your system.
- Verify it's accessible in your terminal by running:
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
- If you see an error, install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

---

### 🛠️ **2. Check VS Code Git Integration**
- Open **View > Extensions** and verify the **Git** extension by Microsoft is enabled.
- Reload VS Code or disable/re-enable the extension.

---

### ⚙️ **3. Verify Git Path in VS Code Settings**
1. Go to **File > Preferences > Settings** (or press `Ctrl + ,`).
2. Search for `git.path`.
3. Ensure the path is correctly set to your Git executable. For example:
   - On **Windows**:  
     ```plaintext
     C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe
     ```
   - On **Linux/Mac**:  
     ```plaintext
     /usr/bin/git
     ```

---

### 💻 **4. Reload VS Code or Restart**
- Reload the window:  
  **View > Command Palette** (`Ctrl + Shift + P`), type `Reload Window`, and press Enter.

---

### 🗃️ **5. Reinstall Git Extension**
- If the issue persists, try reinstalling the Git extension:
  1. Go to **Extensions** in VS Code.
  2. Search for **Git**.
  3. Uninstall and reinstall the extension.

---

### 🧹 **6. Clear VS Code Cache (If Necessary)**
- Sometimes cache issues can cause this error.  
- Close VS Code and delete the cache folder:
  - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Code`
  - **Linux/Mac:** `~/.config/Code`

---

### 📋 **7. Manually Sync via Terminal (Workaround)**
If you're still stuck, use the terminal as a temporary workaround:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

---

### ❓ **Still Not Working?**
If none of the above solutions work, try running VS Code with verbose logging:
```bash
code --log trace
```
This will help identify more specific errors.
