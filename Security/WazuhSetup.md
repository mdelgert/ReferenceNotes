## Installation

Wazuh can be installed in different configurations:

### 1. Install Wazuh All-in-One

The All-in-One configuration is a good starting point for small to medium environments. This setup installs all components (Wazuh server, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, and Wazuh Dashboard) on a single machine.

```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.9/wazuh-install.sh
bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
```

For specific configurations (i.e., multi-server environments), refer to the [Wazuh documentation](https://documentation.wazuh.com).

### 2. Install Wazuh in Distributed Architecture

For scalability and performance in larger environments, deploy each Wazuh component (Manager, Indexer, and Dashboard) on separate servers.

#### Step 1: Install the Wazuh Manager

```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/wazuh-install.sh
bash ./wazuh-install.sh -m
```

#### Step 2: Install the Indexer (Elasticsearch or OpenSearch)

Follow the steps in the official documentation to install and configure your preferred indexer.

#### Step 3: Install the Wazuh Dashboard

```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/wazuh-install.sh
bash ./wazuh-install.sh -d
```

### 3. Adding Agents

To monitor endpoints, install the Wazuh agent on each one:

#### On Linux:

```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/wazuh-agent.sh
bash ./wazuh-agent.sh
```

#### On Windows:

Download the agent installer from the [Wazuh download page](https://documentation.wazuh.com) and follow the setup instructions.

#### Connecting Agent to the Manager

After installation, configure the agent to connect to the Wazuh manager by modifying the agent's configuration file (`ossec.conf`) and restarting the agent.

## Configuration

### Configure Wazuh Manager

Edit `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` to customize manager settings.

### Configure Wazuh Dashboard

Access the Dashboard on `https://<server-ip>:5601` and configure settings for optimal viewing and security.

### Configure Agents

Modify `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` on each agent as needed, or use the Wazuh Dashboard to manage agents.

## Usage

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Open your browser and go to `https://<wazuh-server-ip>:5601`.
2. Log in with your credentials.

### Common Commands

- **Start Wazuh manager**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start wazuh-manager
  ```

- **Start Wazuh agent**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start wazuh-agent
  ```

- **Check Wazuh manager status**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status wazuh-manager
  ```
