On Windows 11, you can scan for errors and repair them using several built-in tools. Here are the main methods:

### 1. **Using the System File Checker (SFC) Tool**
This tool scans for and repairs corrupted or missing system files.

1. Press `Win + X` and select **Windows Terminal (Admin)** or **Command Prompt (Admin)**.
2. In the terminal, type the following command and press `Enter`:
   ```
   sfc /scannow
   ```
3. Wait for the scan to complete. If any corrupt files are found, the tool will automatically repair them.
4. Restart your computer if necessary.

### 2. **Using the DISM Tool (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool)**
DISM can repair the Windows image if the SFC tool is unable to fix the issue.

1. Open **Windows Terminal (Admin)** or **Command Prompt (Admin)** as described above.
2. First, run the following command to check the Windows image:
   ```
   DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
   ```
3. To repair the image, use this command:
   ```
   DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
   ```
4. Wait for the process to finish, then run `sfc /scannow` again to ensure everything is fixed.

### 3. **Using the Check Disk (CHKDSK) Tool**
This tool checks for errors in your file system and disk.

1. Press `Win + X` and select **Windows Terminal (Admin)** or **Command Prompt (Admin)**.
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   chkdsk C: /f /r
   ```
   (Replace `C:` with the appropriate drive letter if needed.)
3. You may be prompted to schedule the check for the next restart. Press `Y` to agree, then restart your computer.
4. The system will scan for and attempt to fix any detected disk errors during boot.

These methods should help scan and repair any system or disk errors on your Windows 11 machine.
