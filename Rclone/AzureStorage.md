If you're looking to mount **Azure Storage** as a general-purpose shared drive for your **home Ubuntu servers**, **Azure Files** is the better choice over **Azure Blob Storage**. Below is a detailed comparison and guidance on the best storage type and pricing tier for your use case.

---

## **Azure Files vs. Azure Blob Storage**

| Feature | **Azure Files** | **Azure Blob Storage** |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Purpose** | General file shares, SMB/NFS mounts | Object storage for unstructured data (e.g., backups, logs) |
| **Mountable on Linux** | Yes (via SMB or NFS) | Not natively mountable (requires Rclone or BlobFuse) |
| **Performance** | Better for file-based workloads | Optimized for large object storage |
| **Protocol Support** | SMB (2.1, 3.0, 3.1.1) & NFS | REST API, BlobFuse (FUSE driver) |
| **Best for** | Home/Enterprise shares, VM shares | Large-scale data storage, backups, archival |

### **Why Choose Azure Files for Your Home Server?**
- **Easier mounting**: You can mount **Azure Files** directly via **SMB or NFS**, making it function just like a traditional network share.
- **Persistent network drive**: Unlike **Blob Storage**, which requires **Rclone** or **BlobFuse**, Azure Files integrates seamlessly with **Linux file systems**.
- **Access control**: Supports **POSIX permissions** and **Active Directory authentication** (if needed).
- **Better suited for general file storage**.

## **Hot vs. Cool vs. Archive Tiers**
Azure storage has different pricing tiers based on usage frequency:

| **Tier** | **Best for** | **Access Frequency** | **Storage Cost** | **Retrieval Cost** |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Hot** | Frequently accessed files | High | Higher | Low |
| **Cool** | Infrequently accessed files | Low | Lower | Higher |
| **Archive** | Long-term cold storage (e.g., backups) | Very rare | Very low | Very high |

### **Which Tier Should You Choose?**
- If your **home servers** will **regularly** access the share, **Hot** tier is recommended.
- If you will **infrequently** access the share but want to keep files available, choose **Cool** storage to save costs.
- **Archive storage is not suitable** since it's designed for long-term backups and takes hours to retrieve files.

#### **Recommended Choice for Your Home Server**
ðŸ”¹ **Use Azure Files with the "Cool" tier** for cost-effective general storage. If you access it daily, **Hot** might be better.

## **How to Set Up and Mount Azure Files on Ubuntu**
### **1. Create an Azure File Share**
1. Go to **Azure Portal** â†’ **Storage Account**.
2. Select **File shares** â†’ Click **+ File Share**.
3. Name your share (e.g., `homeserver-share`).
4. Choose **Cool** tier for cost savings (or Hot for frequent access).
5. Click **Create**.

### **2. Mount Azure File Share on Ubuntu**
To mount the share on your **Ubuntu home servers**, use **SMB** (recommended) or **NFS**.

#### **Method 1: Mount Using SMB (Recommended)**
1. **Install SMB client**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install cifs-utils -y
   ```

2. **Get connection details**:
   - In **Azure Portal**, go to **File share**.
   - Click **Connect** â†’ Select **Linux** â†’ Copy the `mount` command.

3. **Mount the share manually**:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t cifs //yourstorageaccount.file.core.windows.net/homeserver-share /mnt/azurefiles \
   -o vers=3.0,username=yourstorageaccount,password=yourstorageaccountkey,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0777,sec=ntlmssp
   ```

4. **Make the mount persistent** (optional):
   Add the following line to `/etc/fstab`:
   ```bash
   //yourstorageaccount.file.core.windows.net/homeserver-share /mnt/azurefiles cifs vers=3.0,username=yourstorageaccount,password=yourstorageaccountkey,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0777,sec=ntlmssp 0 0
   ```
