### RPI cache issue with smaller root drive
If rpi has smaller drive good idea to change the cache location.

Rclone itself does not have a size limit for individual files, even when using encryption. However, there could be other factors that are causing the issue when transferring large files like your ISO file. The error message (`0x8007045D: I/O device error`) indicates that the issue might be related to input/output (I/O) operations, which can arise for several reasons. Let's go through the possible causes and fixes:

### Possible Causes and Fixes

#### 1. **Azure Blob Storage Limitations**
   - **Block Blob Limitations**: Azure Blob Storage (specifically for **Block Blobs**) can handle files up to **200 GB** in size, so your file size should not be an issue. However, the **default maximum block size** is 4 MB, which can lead to limitations for large files if not configured properly.
   
   **Solution**:
   - You can try increasing the block size for larger files by adding the following option to your Rclone command:
   
     ```bash
     --azureblob-chunk-size 128M
     ```
     This increases the size of each chunk that is uploaded, which can help in transferring larger files more efficiently.

   Example of mounting the Rclone with this option:
   
   ```bash
   rclone mount rclonestorage2-enc:/ /mnt/rclonestorage2-enc --vfs-cache-mode writes --allow-other --azureblob-chunk-size 128M &
   ```

#### 2. **VFS Cache Mode Settings**
   When copying large files, Rclone’s default VFS cache mode might not handle them efficiently. You may want to try changing the cache mode to `full` for better performance when dealing with large files.

   **Solution**:
   Modify your Rclone mount command to include `--vfs-cache-mode full`:

   ```bash
   rclone mount rclonestorage2-enc:/ /mnt/rclonestorage2-enc --vfs-cache-mode full --allow-other --azureblob-chunk-size 128M &
   ```

   The `full` mode caches the entire file, which might help with copying large files.

#### 3. **Disk Space on Local Cache**
   If you're using Rclone’s VFS caching (especially with `writes` or `full` cache mode), make sure there is enough space on the local disk for caching the large file before it is transferred to Azure Blob.

   **Solution**:
   - Check available space on your system using:
     ```bash
     df -h
     ```
   - Free up space if necessary, or specify a different directory with more space for Rclone’s cache using the `--cache-dir` option:

     ```bash
     rclone mount rclonestorage2-enc:/ /mnt/rclonestorage2-enc --vfs-cache-mode full --cache-dir /path/to/larger/directory --allow-other --azureblob-chunk-size 128M &
     ```

#### 4. **File System Limitations**
   The underlying file system on your local machine (or on the storage medium where you are writing) might have file size limitations. For example, FAT32 has a 4 GB file size limit.

   **Solution**:
   - Ensure that the local file system supports files larger than 4 GB (e.g., NTFS, ext4).

#### 5. **Network Issues**
   Large file transfers are more prone to network interruptions. An I/O error like the one you encountered can sometimes occur due to intermittent connectivity issues during large file transfers.

   **Solution**:
   - Ensure a stable network connection.
   - You can also increase the `--timeout` and `--retries` settings in Rclone to handle network interruptions better:

     ```bash
     rclone mount rclonestorage2-enc:/ /mnt/rclonestorage2-enc --vfs-cache-mode writes --timeout 10m --retries 10 --allow-other --azureblob-chunk-size 128M &
     ```

#### 6. **Check Samba Configuration**
   Since you're using Samba to share the mounted directory, there could be a limitation in Samba that’s affecting the large file transfer.

   **Solution**:
   - Ensure that the `max protocol` in Samba is set to a modern protocol like `SMB3` for better handling of large file transfers. You can add this to your Samba configuration:
   
     ```ini
     [global]
     max protocol = SMB3
     ```

   - Restart Samba after making changes:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart smbd
     ```

### Summary

1. **Increase the Azure blob chunk size** using `--azureblob-chunk-size 128M`.
2. **Switch to full VFS cache mode** with `--vfs-cache-mode full`.
3. **Ensure sufficient local disk space** for caching large files.
4. Verify the **local file system** can handle large files.
5. **Check network stability** and adjust timeout settings with `--timeout` and `--retries`.
6. **Adjust Samba configuration** to ensure it's not limiting file sizes.

Try these adjustments, and they should help with transferring large files like your ISO.
