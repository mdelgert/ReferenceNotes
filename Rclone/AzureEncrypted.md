Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up **Rclone** with an encrypted Azure Blob Storage repository:

### Step 1: Install Rclone
Ensure you have Rclone installed. You can install it using the following command on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install rclone fuse3
```

On Windows, you can install it via [winget](https://rclone.org/install/) or download the installer from the Rclone website.

### Step 2: Configure Azure Blob Storage Remote

Run the following command to configure a new remote in Rclone:

```bash
rclone config
```

1. Choose `n` to create a new remote.
2. Name the remote, e.g., `azureblob`.
3. Select `11` for **Microsoft Azure Blob Storage** as the storage type.
4. Enter your Azure **account name**.
5. Enter your Azure **account key** (you can get this from the Azure portal under Storage Accounts > Access keys).
6. Choose the container you want to use or leave it empty to create a new one.
7. Accept the default for the other options unless you need specific customization.

### Step 3: Set Up Encryption for the Remote

After setting up the Azure Blob Storage remote, you’ll create an encrypted remote on top of it. Run the following command again:

```bash
rclone config
```

1. Choose `n` to create another new remote.
2. Name the new remote, e.g., `azureblob-encrypted`.
3. Select `15` for **Encrypt/Decrypt a remote**.
4. When prompted for the remote, type `azureblob:path/to/folder` (replace `path/to/folder` with the folder or container you want to use).
5. Select `s` for **standard encryption**.
6. Choose whether to encrypt filenames (it's safer to encrypt them).
7. Set up a password for encryption (you can also configure a salt to make it more secure).
8. Confirm the details and complete the setup.

### Step 4: Use the Encrypted Remote

Now, you can interact with the encrypted remote as you would with any other remote in Rclone. For example, to copy files to the encrypted Azure Blob Storage:

```bash
rclone copy /path/to/local/files azureblob-encrypted:/backup
```

### Step 5: Automate with Cron or Scripts

You can create a script to automate the backup process. Here’s an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup script using Rclone to encrypted Azure Blob

# Environment variables for Rclone
export RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS=<encryption_password>

# Run Rclone sync or copy
rclone sync /path/to/local/files azureblob-encrypted:/backup

# Optional: Add logs
echo "$(date): Backup completed" >> /var/log/rclone-backup.log
```

### Step 6: Store Passwords Securely (Optional)

If you're running this in a cron job or other non-interactive session, you may want to store the Azure credentials and Rclone password securely using a secrets manager like **Azure Key Vault** or **environment variables** in your script.

Now, your Azure Blob storage repository will be encrypted, and you can manage backups using Rclone!
