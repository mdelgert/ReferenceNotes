To mount an encrypted Azure Blob storage repository using **Rclone**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Required Tools

Ensure Rclone is installed, as well as `fuse` for mounting. On Ubuntu, you can install fuse with:

```bash
sudo apt install fuse
```

On Windows, install [WinFsp](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp) to enable file system mounting, as it's required for Rclone.

### Step 2: Verify Encrypted Remote Configuration

Before proceeding with mounting, verify that your encrypted remote is correctly configured by listing files using:

```bash
rclone ls azureblob-encrypted:/
```

If this command shows your files or an empty directory, you are set up correctly.

### Step 3: Create a Mount Directory

Create a local directory where you want to mount the encrypted storage:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/mnt/azureblob-encrypted
```

### Step 4: Mount the Encrypted Remote

Use the `rclone mount` command to mount the encrypted remote to the directory you just created. The command looks like this:

```bash
rclone mount azureblob-encrypted:/ ~/mnt/azureblob-encrypted --vfs-cache-mode writes
```

- Replace `azureblob-encrypted:/` with your encrypted remote path.
- `~/mnt/azureblob-encrypted` is the mount point (where you will access the files).
- The `--vfs-cache-mode writes` option ensures smoother file handling by caching written files locally before uploading.

### Step 5: Run the Mount in the Background

To keep the mount running in the background and ensure that it works after closing the terminal, add `&` at the end of the mount command:

```bash
rclone mount azureblob-encrypted:/ ~/mnt/azureblob-encrypted --vfs-cache-mode writes &
```

On Linux, you can use the `nohup` command to prevent the process from being interrupted if the terminal session closes:

```bash
nohup rclone mount azureblob-encrypted:/ ~/mnt/azureblob-encrypted --vfs-cache-mode writes &
```

On Windows, you can run Rclone as a service using the Task Scheduler or use the command prompt with `start` to keep it running.

### Step 6: Access Files

Once mounted, your Azure Blob storage will be accessible like a local directory in `~/mnt/azureblob-encrypted`. You can interact with files as if they were on your local system.

### Step 7: Unmounting the Remote

When youâ€™re done, you can unmount the remote with the following command on Linux or macOS:

```bash
fusermount -u ~/mnt/azureblob-encrypted
```

On Windows, use the following:

```bash
rclone unmount X:  # If you mapped it to a drive letter X
```

### Automating the Mount at Startup

To automate the mount, you can create a systemd service (for Linux):

1. Create a service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/rclone-azureblob.service
```

2. Add the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Mount Rclone Encrypted Azure Blob Storage
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=<your-username>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/rclone mount azureblob-encrypted:/ /home/<your-username>/mnt/azureblob-encrypted --vfs-cache-mode writes
ExecStop=/bin/fusermount -u /home/<your-username>/mnt/azureblob-encrypted
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable rclone-azureblob
sudo systemctl start rclone-azureblob
```

This way, the encrypted Azure Blob storage will mount automatically after each reboot.

With these steps, your encrypted storage will be accessible as a local directory, and you can automate the mounting process if necessary!
