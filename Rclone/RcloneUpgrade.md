To upgrade `rclone` to the latest version, you can follow these steps based on your operating system:

### On Linux/Ubuntu:
1. First, remove the existing version (optional):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get remove rclone
   ```
   
2. Download the latest version of `rclone`:
   ```bash
   curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```

3. Verify the installation by checking the version:
   ```bash
   rclone --version
   ```

### On Windows:
1. Download the latest `rclone` release from the [official website](https://rclone.org/downloads/).
2. Unzip the downloaded file to a folder, such as `C:\Program Files\rclone`.
3. If `rclone` is already in your systemâ€™s PATH, you can simply overwrite the existing files. Otherwise, you can add the new version to the PATH by following these steps:
   - Open **System Properties** > **Advanced System Settings** > **Environment Variables**.
   - Edit the `Path` variable and add the directory where `rclone.exe` is located.
   
4. Check the updated version:
   ```cmd
   rclone --version
   ```

### On macOS (via Homebrew):
1. If installed via Homebrew, update and upgrade with:
   ```bash
   brew update
   brew upgrade rclone
   ```

2. Verify the updated version:
   ```bash
   rclone --version
   ```

After upgrading, you can verify the upgrade was successful by checking the version as shown above.
