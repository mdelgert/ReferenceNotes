If your LXC containers and Proxmox server (e.g., `pve` or `pve.local`) are on the same network but cannot be resolved while other machines are resolvable, it suggests that there might be some specific DNS, mDNS, or local name resolution configuration issues. Here are a few things to investigate and address:

### 1. **mDNS or LLMNR Configuration**
   - **Windows and Linux Machines:** Many Linux and Windows machines use mDNS (Multicast DNS) or LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) for local hostname resolution (e.g., `.local` domain).
   - **Proxmox and LXC Containers:** Proxmox servers and LXC containers might not have mDNS or LLMNR services enabled by default, which could explain why `pve` or `pve.local` is not resolvable.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Install and configure `avahi-daemon` on both the Proxmox host and LXC containers to enable mDNS support (which allows resolving `.local` names in the network). You can do this with:
     ```bash
     apt install avahi-daemon
     systemctl enable avahi-daemon
     systemctl start avahi-daemon
     ```
   - Once this is running, you should be able to resolve `pve.local` or `container-name.local`.

### 2. **DNS Server Settings**
   - If youâ€™re relying on a DNS server to resolve hostnames, ensure that the DNS server knows about your LXC containers and the Proxmox host.
   - In some cases, dynamic DNS updates may not be enabled, or your DNS server may not automatically register the Proxmox or LXC hostnames.
   - Verify that your `resolv.conf` file on both Proxmox and the LXC containers is pointing to the correct DNS server.
   
   **Solution:**
   - If using a central DNS server (e.g., provided by your router or a dedicated DNS server), check that the LXC containers and Proxmox server are correctly registered. You may need to manually create DNS entries for the LXC containers and Proxmox (`pve`).
   - Also, verify the DNS search domain on the machines to ensure they're consistent.

### 3. **Check `/etc/hosts` File on Proxmox and LXC Containers**
   - Sometimes, adding hostname entries to `/etc/hosts` can resolve local name resolution issues, especially if DNS and mDNS are unreliable.

   **Solution:**
   - Ensure that `/etc/hosts` on the Proxmox host and LXC containers includes entries like:
     ```bash
     192.168.1.x pve pve.local
     192.168.1.x lxc-container-name
     ```

### 4. **Firewall Configuration**
   - A firewall on Proxmox, LXC, or other network devices could be blocking the necessary traffic for name resolution. Name resolution protocols like mDNS, LLMNR, or even regular DNS can be blocked.

   **Solution:**
   - Ensure that the necessary multicast and DNS traffic is not being blocked on your Proxmox host, LXC containers, or by network firewall rules.
   - On Proxmox, check `iptables` rules or any other firewall setup:
     ```bash
     iptables -L
     ```

### 5. **Proxmox Hostname Configuration**
   - If `pve` is not resolvable but other machines are, the issue might be that the Proxmox hostname is not correctly configured or advertised on the network.

   **Solution:**
   - Verify the hostname configuration on the Proxmox host with:
     ```bash
     hostnamectl
     ```
   - Ensure that `/etc/hostname` contains `pve`.
   - Make sure `/etc/hosts` has the correct mapping:
     ```bash
     127.0.0.1 pve.local pve
     ```

### 6. **Network Configuration in Proxmox (Bridge Mode)**
   - If Proxmox or the LXC containers are using bridged networking, ensure that all the network interfaces are properly configured and have IP addresses within the same subnet as the rest of your network.
   
   **Solution:**
   - On Proxmox, ensure that your bridge (e.g., `vmbr0`) is properly configured to forward traffic between the LXC containers and the network. You can check your network configuration in `/etc/network/interfaces`.

### 7. **NetBIOS/LLMNR on Windows**
   - Windows machines often rely on NetBIOS or LLMNR for local name resolution.
   
   **Solution:**
   - If other machines can resolve each other via NetBIOS/LLMNR, consider installing `winbind` on your Proxmox host and LXC containers. This allows them to participate in NetBIOS/LLMNR-based name resolution.
     ```bash
     apt install winbind
     ```

### Summary of Actions to Take:
- Install and enable `avahi-daemon` on Proxmox and LXC containers for mDNS resolution.
- Check DNS server settings to ensure Proxmox and LXC containers are registered.
- Review and update `/etc/hosts` files on Proxmox and LXC containers.
- Verify network and firewall settings, ensuring no rules block multicast or DNS.
- Confirm correct hostname configuration on Proxmox (`hostnamectl` and `/etc/hosts`).

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `pve` and LXC container names across your network.
