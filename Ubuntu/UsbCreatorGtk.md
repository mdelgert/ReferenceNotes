To make a USB drive boot from an ISO file on Ubuntu, you can use a tool called "Startup Disk Creator". Here's how you can do it:

1. Insert your USB drive into your computer.

2. Open the Terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.

3. Run the following command to open the "Startup Disk Creator" tool:
```
usb-creator-gtk
```

4. In the "Startup Disk Creator" tool, click on "Other" and then select the ISO file you want to use.

5. Select the USB drive that you inserted earlier as the "Disk to use".

6. Click on "Make Startup Disk" to start the process of creating a bootable USB drive from the ISO file.

7. Once the process is complete, you can safely remove the USB drive from your computer.

Now you can boot from the USB drive with the ISO file you selected. Make sure to change the boot order in your BIOS settings to boot from the USB drive first.
